/**
 * SCORING STYLE: STROKE PLAY (scoring_style = 'stroke_play' | 'total_score' | 'total_strokes')
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IT DOES: Sums round1-4 to-par values per player, drops N worst, totals the rest.
 * WINNING:      LOWEST team score wins (-10 beats +2).
 * FORMULA:      player_total = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 (nulls excluded, not treated as 0)
 *               team_score   = sum of counting players' totals
 *
 * made_cut values:
 *   0    = confirmed missed cut / WD / DQ → player auto-drops (no scores needed)
 *   1    = confirmed made cut
 *   null = unknown (tournament in progress, cut not yet determined, R1/R2)
 *          → treat same as active/pending, NOT as missed cut
 *
 * NO bonuses, NO cut penalties, NO multipliers — just raw to-par strokes.
 * Even par (0) = 0 pts. -4 means 4 under par (good). +2 means 2 over par (bad).
 *
 * Apply "Best X of Y" drop scoring to a team's picks.
 *
 * Categories:
 *   MC/WD   = made_cut === 0 (missed cut or withdrew) — ONLY explicit 0, not null
 *   ACTIVE  = has round scores AND not cut/WD
 *   PENDING = no round scores yet AND not cut (hasn't teed off)
 *
 * Drop modes:
 *   AUTO (lockedDroppedIds = null):
 *     1. MC/WD players auto-drop first (no penalty, just removed)
 *     2. Remaining drops = worst ACTIVE players by total to-par score (r1 tiebreaker)
 *     3. PENDING players excluded from scoring — not penalized
 *   LOCKED (lockedDroppedIds = Set<player_id>):
 *     Commissioner applied drops are persisted in DB. Use those IDs directly.
 *     MC players still excluded from scoring but shown as MC, not DROPPED.
 *     dropCount is ignored in locked mode.
 *
 * @param {Array}  picks              - rows with: player_id, round1-4, made_cut
 * @param {number} dropCount          - how many players to drop (0 = no drops)
 * @param {object} [opts]
 * @param {Set<string>|null} [opts.lockedDroppedIds] - persisted drop IDs from DB;
 *   when provided, skip worst-N computation and use this set instead.
 * @returns {{ picks, team_score, counting_count, dropped_count }}
