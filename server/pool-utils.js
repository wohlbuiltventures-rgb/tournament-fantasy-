/**
 * Apply "Best X of Y" drop scoring to a team's picks.
 *
 * Categories:
 *   MC/WD   = made_cut === 0 (missed cut or withdrew)
 *   ACTIVE  = has round scores AND not cut/WD
 *   PENDING = no round scores yet AND not cut (hasn't teed off)
 *
 * Drop order:
 *   1. MC/WD players auto-drop first (no penalty, just removed)
 *   2. Remaining drops = worst ACTIVE players by total to-par score
 *   3. PENDING players excluded from scoring — not penalized
 *
 * @param {Array}  picks     - rows with: player_id, round1-4, made_cut
 * @param {number} dropCount - how many players to drop (0 = no drops)
 * @returns {{ picks, team_score, counting_count, dropped_count }}
